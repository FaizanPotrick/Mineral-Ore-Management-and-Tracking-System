# Mineral Ore Management and Tracking System


This web portal is developed to manage, monitor and restrict irregularities in mineral ore export. Producers have been known to misclassify one grade for another to pay a reduced royalty fee for that grade. State governments lose revenue as a result of this. Usage of QR for uniquely identifying a batch being transported helps granular level tracking of the iron ore. Our solution will be very effective as it will track the iron ore from the ores to the end points and would also reduce the loss incurred to the state government.


## Built With


- [Vue js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Features


- #### The mines have to enter details of iron ore through several points of iron ore selling and transporting process.
- #### Transactions with certain rate of percentage difference from average will be marked as suspicious and an alert will be sent to the officer incharge.
- #### During the transport, QR code is generated for the vehicles which will allow unique verification and checking at checkpoints along the way.
